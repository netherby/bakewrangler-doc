Install & Update
================

There are no special steps required to install the add-on.
Simply open your blender preferences, navigate to the *Add-ons*
tab (left column) and click the '*Install...*' button near the
top right. In the '*File View*' that opens navigate to the location
of the Bake Wrangler zip file and click '*Install Add-on*' with
it selected or double click on the zip file.

Once installed you need to check the box on the add-on to enable it.

**Updating:**

When updating follow the same procedure (making sure the '*Overwrite*'
box is checked in the '*File Viewer*' when selecting the new version).
Sometimes changes are made the require blender to be restarted, though
I try to avoid this, it is a good idea to do so after updating if things
don't seem to be working right.

Recipes from older versions of the add-on can be updated to the latest
version by using the '*Update*' button in the right side ('N') panel found
in the '*Bake Wrangler*' tab.
